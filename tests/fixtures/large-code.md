# Large Code Example

This file contains a large code block for testing compression.

```javascript
// This is a large code block that should be compressed
function largeFunction() {
  const line1 = 'This is line 1';
  const line2 = 'This is line 2';
  const line3 = 'This is line 3';
  const line4 = 'This is line 4';
  const line5 = 'This is line 5';
  const line6 = 'This is line 6';
  const line7 = 'This is line 7';
  const line8 = 'This is line 8';
  const line9 = 'This is line 9';
  const line10 = 'This is line 10';
  const line11 = 'This is line 11';
  const line12 = 'This is line 12';
  const line13 = 'This is line 13';
  const line14 = 'This is line 14';
  const line15 = 'This is line 15';
  const line16 = 'This is line 16';
  const line17 = 'This is line 17';
  const line18 = 'This is line 18';
  const line19 = 'This is line 19';
  const line20 = 'This is line 20';
  const line21 = 'This is line 21';
  const line22 = 'This is line 22';
  const line23 = 'This is line 23';
  const line24 = 'This is line 24';
  const line25 = 'This is line 25';
  const line26 = 'This is line 26';
  const line27 = 'This is line 27';
  const line28 = 'This is line 28';
  const line29 = 'This is line 29';
  const line30 = 'This is line 30';
  
  return 'completed';
}
```

And some JSON:

```json
{
  "key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2",
  "key3": "value3",
  "key4": "value4",
  "key5": "value5",
  "key6": "value6",
  "key7": "value7",
  "key8": "value8",
  "key9": "value9",
  "key10": "value10",
  "key11": "value11",
  "key12": "value12",
  "key13": "value13",
  "key14": "value14",
  "key15": "value15",
  "nested": {
    "deep": {
      "value": true
    }
  }
}
```
