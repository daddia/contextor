## Incident Response

### P1 Incidents (Critical)

**Definition**: Complete service outage, data loss, security breach

**Immediate Response** (< 5 minutes):
1. **Acknowledge** the incident in [incident tracking system]
2. **Assess** the scope and impact
3. **Engage** the on-call team
4. **Communicate** status to stakeholders

**Investigation Steps**:
```bash
# Commands to check service status
# Commands to check logs
# Commands to check dependencies
```

**Common P1 Scenarios**:

#### Service Completely Down
**Symptoms**: Health checks failing, 500 errors, no response
**Investigation**:
```bash
# Check if service is running
# Check system resources
# Check dependency health
```
**Resolution**:
```bash
# Steps to restore service
```

#### Database Connection Failures
**Symptoms**: Database timeout errors, connection pool exhausted
**Investigation**:
```bash
# Check database status
# Check connection pool metrics
```
**Resolution**:
```bash
# Steps to resolve database issues
```

### P2 Incidents (High Priority)

**Definition**: Significant functionality impacted, performance degraded

**Response Time**: < 30 minutes

**Common P2 Scenarios**:

#### High Response Times
**Symptoms**: Slow responses, timeout warnings
**Investigation**:
- Check performance metrics
- Review recent deployments
- Analyze resource usage

**Resolution**:
- Scale resources if needed
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Apply performance fixes

#### Elevated Error Rate
**Symptoms**: Increased 4xx/5xx errors
**Investigation**:
```bash
# Check error logs
# Analyze error patterns
```

---

## Troubleshooting Procedures

### Performance Issues

**Symptoms to Look For**:
- High response times
- CPU/memory spikes
- Database slow queries

**Diagnostic Steps**:
```bash
# Check system metrics
top
df -h

# Check application metrics
# [Add project-specific monitoring commands]

# Check logs for errors
# [Add log viewing commands]
```

**Common Solutions**:
- Restart service to clear memory leaks
- Scale horizontally to distribute load
- Clear cache to resolve data issues
- Apply database optimizations

### Configuration Issues

**Symptoms**: Service behaving unexpectedly
**Diagnostic Steps**:
```bash
# Verify configuration
# [Add configuration checking commands]

# Compare with working environment
# [Add comparison commands]
```

**Resolution**:
```bash
# Fix configuration
# [Add configuration update commands]
```

---

## Log Analysis

### Important Log Locations

```bash
# Application logs
tail -f /path/to/application.log

# System logs  
tail -f /var/log/syslog

# Service-specific logs
# [Add service-specific log locations]
```

### Key Log Patterns

#### Error Patterns
```bash
# Search for errors
grep -i "error\|exception\|failed" application.log

# Search for specific error types
grep "DatabaseError" application.log
```

#### Performance Patterns
```bash
# Search for slow operations
grep "slow\|timeout" application.log

# Search for resource issues
grep "memory\|cpu\|disk" application.log
```

# Commands to verify backup integrity
```

### Disaster Recovery

**Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: [Maximum acceptable data loss]
**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: [Maximum acceptable downtime]

**Recovery Steps**:
1. **Assess the situation**
   ```bash
   # Commands to assess damage/scope
   ```

2. **Restore from backup**
   ```bash
   # Commands to restore data
   ```

3. **Verify recovery**
