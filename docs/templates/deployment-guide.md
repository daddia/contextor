cp .env.example .env.dev
# Edit .env.dev with development settings
```

**Key Configuration:**
- Database: [Development database setup]
- External Services: [Mock services or development endpoints]
- Debugging: [Debug mode enabled, verbose logging]

---

### Staging Environment

**Purpose**: Pre-production testing and validation

**Setup:**
```bash
# Commands to deploy to staging
```

**Key Configuration:**
- Database: [Staging database configuration]
- External Services: [Staging service endpoints]
- Features: [Feature flags for testing]

**Validation Steps:**
1. [Step 1 to validate deployment]
2. [Step 2 to validate functionality]
3. [Step 3 to validate integrations]

---

### Production Environment

**Purpose**: Live production system

**Setup:**
```bash
# Commands to deploy to production
```

**Key Configuration:**
