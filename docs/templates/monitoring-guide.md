## Logging

### Log Levels

| Level | Usage | Examples |
|-------|-------|----------|
| ERROR | System errors, exceptions | Application crashes, integration failures |
| WARN  | Warning conditions | Deprecated feature usage, high resource usage |
| INFO  | General information | User actions, system state changes |
| DEBUG | Detailed debugging info | Request/response data, internal state |

### Log Format

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "User login successful",
  "context": {
    "user_id": "123",
    "request_id": "req-456",
    "trace_id": "trace-789"
  }
}
```

### Log Access

#### Development
```bash
# Commands to access development logs
docker logs -f [container-name]
tail -f logs/application.log
```

#### Production
```bash
# Commands to access production logs
# Or provide links to log aggregation system
```

### Log Retention

- **Development**: [Retention period]
- **Staging**: [Retention period]
- **Production**: [Retention period]

## Alerting

### Alert Categories

#### Critical Alerts

**Criteria**: Service down, data loss, security incidents
**Response Time**: Immediate (< 5 minutes)
**Escalation**: On-call engineer, team lead

| Alert | Trigger | Response |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Service Down | Health check fails for > 2 minutes | Immediate investigation |
| High Error Rate | Error rate > 10% for > 5 minutes | Check logs, investigate cause |
| Database Down | Database connection failures | Check database health, failover if needed |

#### Warning Alerts

**Criteria**: Performance degradation, high resource usage
**Response Time**: Within business hours (< 1 hour)
**Escalation**: Team notification

| Alert | Trigger | Response |
|-------|---------|----------|
| High Response Time | p95 > [X]ms for > 10 minutes | Check performance metrics, scale if needed |
| High CPU Usage | CPU > 85% for > 15 minutes | Monitor and prepare to scale |
| Low Disk Space | Disk usage > 90% | Clean up logs, increase storage |

### Alert Configuration

```yaml
# Example alerting rules
# Add your actual alerting configuration
```

## Distributed Tracing

### Trace Collection

**System**: [Tracing system being used]
**Sampling Rate**: [Percentage of requests traced]

### Trace Analysis

**Access**: [How to access traces]
**Key Traces to Monitor**:
- End-to-end request flows
- Database query performance
- External service calls
- Error scenarios

---

## Health Checks

### Application Health

**Endpoint**: `GET /health`

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "checks": {
    "database": "healthy",
    "external_service": "healthy",
    "cache": "healthy"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Infrastructure Health

## Incident Response

### Incident Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Escalation |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| P1 | Service completely down | < 5 minutes | Immediate, all-hands |
| P2 | Major functionality impacted | < 30 minutes | On-call team |
| P3 | Minor issues, workarounds available | < 2 hours | Normal business hours |
| P4 | Enhancement requests | Best effort | Next sprint planning |

### Incident Response Process

1. **Detection**: [How incidents are detected]
2. **Assessment**: [How severity is determined]
3. **Response**: [Who responds and how]
4. **Communication**: [How stakeholders are notified]
5. **Resolution**: [How issues are resolved]
6. **Post-Mortem**: [Post-incident review process]

## Troubleshooting Monitoring Issues

### Missing Metrics

**Symptoms**: Metrics not appearing in dashboards
**Common Causes**: 
- Configuration errors
- Network connectivity issues
- Service discovery problems

**Resolution**:
1. [Debugging steps]
2. [Common fixes]

### Alert Fatigue

**Symptoms**: Too many false positive alerts
**Solutions**:
- Review alert thresholds
- Implement alert suppression for known issues
- Consolidate related alerts

---

## Best Practices

### Monitoring

- **Monitor business outcomes**, not just technical metrics
- **Set up monitoring before deployment**, not after issues arise
- **Use both push and pull metrics** for reliability
- **Monitor the monitoring system** itself

### Alerting

- **Alert on symptoms**, not causes
- **Make alerts actionable** with clear next steps
- **Avoid alert fatigue** with appropriate thresholds
- **Document response procedures** for each alert

### Logging

- **Use structured logging** for easier parsing and analysis
- **Include context** like request IDs and user IDs
- **Avoid logging sensitive information** like passwords or tokens
- **Use appropriate log levels** consistently
