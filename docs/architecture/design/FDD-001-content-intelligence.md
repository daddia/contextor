# Advanced Content Intelligence Feature Design

## Summary

Advanced Content Intelligence enhances Contextor's existing document processing pipeline by adding post-processing analysis capabilities that extract topics, identify relationships, detect duplicates, and assess content quality across document corpora.

This feature operates as a separate CLI command that runs after initial document transformation, enabling comprehensive cross-document analysis without impacting the performance of the core optimization pipeline. The intelligence layer enriches `.mdc` files with structured metadata and creates dedicated indexes to support semantic search and relationship discovery for downstream agents and tools.

## Goals

- Extract semantic topics from document content using NLP analysis of headings, keywords, and body text, merging with user-provided topics
- Identify cross-document relationships and suggest related pages based on content similarity and topic overlap
- Detect near-duplicate and highly similar content across document sources to flag redundancy
- Assess content quality metrics including completeness, freshness, and clarity scores
- Create searchable intelligence indexes that enable fast relationship queries and semantic discovery
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing `.mdc` schema while extending frontmatter with intelligence metadata
- Support incremental processing to analyze only changed documents on subsequent runs

## Non-goals

- Real-time intelligence processing during initial document transformation
- Machine learning model training or custom NLP pipeline development
- Content generation or automated content improvement
- Integration with external AI services or APIs requiring network calls
- Semantic search implementation within the intelligence processor itself

## Requirements

### Functional
- New `contextor intelligence` CLI command accepting source directory, feature flags, and incremental processing options
- Topic extraction from document headings, content keywords, and metadata using established NLP libraries
- Cross-document relationship analysis calculating similarity scores and identifying related content
- Duplicate detection flagging content with similarity scores above configurable thresholds
- Quality scoring algorithm evaluating completeness, freshness, and structural clarity
- Enhanced `.mdc` frontmatter schema including intelligence section with extracted topics, relationships, quality metrics
- Separate `intelligence.jsonl` index file for fast relationship queries and topic-based discovery
- Analysis state tracking via `.intelligence-state.json` to support incremental processing

### Non-functional
- Intelligence processing completes within 5x the time of initial document transformation for equivalent document sets
- Memory usage remains below 2GB for document corpora up to 10,000 files
- Analysis accuracy maintains 85% precision for topic extraction and 90% for relationship identification on representative test sets
- Incremental processing analyzes only changed documents, reducing processing time by 80% for typical update scenarios
- Intelligence indexes support sub-second query response times for relationship lookups
- Processing supports concurrent analysis of up to 4 documents simultaneously without memory pressure

## Architecture & Data Flow

Intelligence processing operates as a post-transformation analysis layer triggered by the sourcedocs repository via GitHub Actions or manual execution. The `contextor intelligence` command loads existing `.mdc` files from the target directory, performs two-phase analysis (individual document analysis followed by cross-document relationship mapping), and updates files in-place with intelligence metadata.

The IntelligenceAnalyzer orchestrates the pipeline through individual analyzers: TopicExtractor processes document content using spaCy for keyword extraction and heading analysis; QualityScorer evaluates structural completeness and content freshness; SimilarityAnalyzer computes document fingerprints and cross-document similarity matrices; CrossLinker identifies relationships based on topic overlap and content similarity scores.

Analysis state persists in `.intelligence-state.json` tracking document hashes and last analysis timestamps to enable incremental processing. The separate `intelligence.jsonl` index maintains relationship mappings, topic hierarchies, and quality metrics for fast querying by downstream tools and MCP server endpoints.

## Caching & Runtime

Intelligence analysis operates on static filesystem content with no runtime caching requirements. Analysis state caching occurs through the `.intelligence-state.json` file which tracks document content hashes to determine incremental processing eligibility. Document similarity matrices cache in memory during cross-document analysis phases to avoid recomputation. The intelligence index file serves as a persistent cache for relationship queries, updated atomically after successful analysis completion.

## Observability

Intelligence processing emits structured logs including document processing rates, analysis phase durations, error counts by type, and quality score distributions. Key metrics include documents analyzed per second, memory usage peaks, relationship extraction accuracy, and incremental processing cache hit rates.

Required log attributes include source_directory, document_count, analysis_features_enabled, processing_duration_seconds, documents_processed, documents_skipped, relationships_found, topics_extracted, quality_scores_computed, and error_details.

Performance dashboards track analysis throughput trends, memory utilization patterns, and processing time distributions. SLO measurements monitor analysis completion time remaining below 5x baseline transformation time and relationship query response times under 100ms. Alert conditions trigger on processing failures exceeding 5% of documents, memory usage above 2GB, or analysis duration exceeding 2x expected time for document count.

## Security & Privacy

Intelligence analysis operates exclusively on local filesystem content with no network access or external service dependencies. Input validation ensures document paths remain within specified source directories and prevents directory traversal attacks. Analysis processes document content in memory without persistent storage of intermediate results except for the intelligence state file.

No authentication or authorization mechanisms required as processing operates within the existing filesystem security model. Content hashing uses SHA-256 for integrity verification without exposing document content. Intelligence metadata extraction preserves existing license attribution and source provenance without modification.

## Configuration

Intelligence configuration supports `intelligence.yaml` files specifying analysis thresholds, feature toggles, and processing parameters.

Key configuration surface includes `topic_extraction_enabled`, `cross_linking_enabled`, `quality_scoring_enabled`, `duplicate_detection_enabled`, `similarity_threshold` (default 0.8), `quality_completeness_weight` (default 0.4), `max_related_documents` (default 5), and `incremental_processing_enabled` (default true).

Configuration validation ensures threshold values remain within valid ranges, feature combinations remain compatible, and processing limits prevent resource exhaustion. Hot-reload behavior not required as configuration loads once per analysis run. No secrets handling required for local filesystem processing.

## Testing & Quality

Unit tests cover individual analyzer components including TopicExtractor accuracy on sample documents, QualityScorer consistency across document types, SimilarityAnalyzer precision with known similar/dissimilar pairs, and CrossLinker relationship identification correctness.

Integration tests validate end-to-end intelligence processing including incremental processing behavior, configuration loading, error handling, and output format compliance. Contract tests ensure enhanced `.mdc` schema compatibility and intelligence index format stability.

Performance benchmarks establish baseline processing times for document sets of varying sizes and validate memory usage remains within specified limits. Architecture tests verify module boundaries and dependency isolation between analyzer components. Coverage goals target 85% line coverage for analyzer modules and 95% for integration workflows.

CI gates include unit test passage, integration test success, performance benchmark compliance, and schema validation for generated intelligence metadata.

## Performance Budgets & Validation

Intelligence processing targets completion within 5x the baseline document transformation time, with specific budgets of p95 processing time ≤ 150ms per document for individual analysis and ≤ 500ms per document for cross-document relationship analysis. Memory usage must remain below 2GB peak for corpora up to 10,000 documents.

Throughput expectations include processing 20 documents per second for individual analysis phases and 5 documents per second for relationship analysis phases. Incremental processing must achieve 80% time reduction compared to full analysis for typical update scenarios with 10% document changes.

Load test scenarios include processing Next.js documentation (500+ documents), React documentation (800+ documents), and synthetic corpora up to 10,000 documents. Benchmark validation runs automatically in CI for representative document sets with performance regression alerts triggering on 20% degradation.

## Rollout Plan

Intelligence processing deploys as an optional CLI command in contextor v0.3.0 with feature flags controlling individual analysis capabilities. Initial rollout enables topic extraction and quality scoring with cross-linking and duplicate detection following in subsequent releases.

Migration plan includes schema version updates for enhanced `.mdc` frontmatter and intelligence index format establishment. Canary deployment processes intelligence analysis on smaller document sets before full corpus analysis. Fallback mechanisms preserve existing `.mdc` files without intelligence metadata if processing fails.

Rollout sequence begins with topic extraction deployment, followed by quality scoring, then relationship analysis, and finally duplicate detection. Dependencies include spaCy model downloads and configuration file establishment in target repositories.

## Risks & Alternatives

Key risks include processing performance degradation impacting CI pipeline execution times, memory usage exceeding runner limitations causing failures, and analysis accuracy producing misleading relationship suggestions. Mitigations include processing time budgets with failure thresholds, memory monitoring with graceful degradation, and accuracy validation against curated test datasets.

Alternative approaches considered include real-time analysis during initial transformation (rejected due to performance impact), external service integration for advanced NLP (rejected due to network dependency requirements), and database-backed relationship storage (rejected due to complexity and GitHub-native architecture principles).

Processing time risk mitigation includes incremental analysis implementation and concurrent processing with resource limits. Memory pressure mitigation includes streaming document processing and intermediate result cleanup. Accuracy risk mitigation includes configurable similarity thresholds and manual relationship validation capabilities.

## Open Questions

Optimal similarity threshold values for relationship identification require validation against representative document corpora with manual relationship labeling. Topic extraction accuracy improvements may benefit from domain-specific keyword dictionaries or custom term weighting approaches.

Cross-document analysis scalability beyond 10,000 documents needs evaluation for memory usage patterns and processing time scaling characteristics. Integration patterns with downstream MCP server relationship query endpoints require API design coordination.

Configuration management approaches for repository-specific analysis parameters and threshold tuning need standardization across different documentation sources and content types.
